# Project Status

## Current Phase

```text
Front-End baseline completed through DFT, N2N, ATPG, and post-DFT SDF STA

## Next Milestone

```text
Review remaining DRC notes before calling the flow signoff-clean.
```

```

## Current Notes

```text
DFT is topographical and writes post-DFT DDC/VG/SDC/SDF/SPF.
SPF is written after insert_dft so TetraMAX sees chain0 length 2130.
TetraMAX stuck-at ATPG reached 98.64% test coverage and 98.55% fault coverage.
Remaining notes: DC DFT TEST-505 constant-1 clock gate, TetraMAX Z3 wire contention warnings, and physical max_cap/max_transition cleanup deferred to backend.
