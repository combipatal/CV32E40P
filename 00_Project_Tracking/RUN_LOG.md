Date: 2026-05-07
Command: source ~/.bashrc; dc_shell -f 2_Synthesis/0_Script/run_analyze_elab_link.tcl
Stage: DC analyze/elaborate/link
Result: FAIL
Notes: Script used invalid DC syntax, analyze -format sverilog -f filelists/cv32e40p_dc.f. DC interpreted -f as -format. Fixed by adding filelists/cv32e40p_dc.tcl and analyzing explicit RTL_FILES list.

Date: 2026-05-07
Command: source ~/.bashrc; dc_shell -f 2_Synthesis/0_Script/run_analyze_elab_link.tcl
Stage: DC analyze/elaborate/link
Result: PASS
Notes: RTL analyzed, cv32e40p_synth_wrap elaborated, link completed. Generated 2_Synthesis/2_Output/pre_dft/cv32e40p_synth_wrap.elab.ddc. check_design has many LINT warnings from disabled FPU/PULP/PMP/APU paths and constants; no unresolved design blocker seen.

Command: source ~/.bashrc; dc_shell -f 2_Synthesis/0_Script/run_compile_10ns.tcl
Stage: DC compile
Result: INVALID
Notes: compile_ultra completed and wrote pre_dft DDC/VG/SVF, but read_sdc reported unknown command remove_from_collection. Timing numbers from this run are not used. Fixed constraints/cv32e40p_func_10ns.sdc by listing input/output ports explicitly.

Date: 2026-05-07
Command: source ~/.bashrc; dc_shell -f 2_Synthesis/0_Script/run_compile_10ns.tcl
Stage: DC compile
Result: PASS_WITH_NOTE
Notes: Final 10 ns mixed-VT TT compile completed. Outputs: 2_Synthesis/2_Output/pre_dft/cv32e40p_synth_wrap.pre_dft.ddc, .vg, .sdc, and 2_Synthesis/2_Output/svf/cv32e40p_synth_wrap.pre_dft.svf. DC QoR: setup WNS 0.02 ns, TNS 0.00, no setup/hold violating paths, cell area 44899.37. DC reports one max_cap violation at rounded 16.00/16.00, treated as residual DRC item.

Command: source ~/.bashrc; pt_shell -f 6_STA/0_Script/run_pt_pre_dft_10ns.tcl
Stage: PrimeTime pre-DFT STA
Result: PASS_WITH_NOTE
Notes: PT linked synthesized netlist and read functional 10 ns SDC. check_timing succeeded. No setup or hold violations. Worst setup slack is 0.02 ns on path u_core/core_i/id_stage_i/prepost_useincr_ex_o_reg -> data_addr_o[31]. PT reports 476 max_cap violations; keep as next investigation before calling full front-end closure.

Date: 2026-05-07
Command: source ~/.bashrc; dc_shell -topographical_mode -f 2_Synthesis/0_Script/run_compile_10ns_topo.tcl
Stage: DC Graphical topographical compile
Result: PASS_WITH_NOTE
Notes: Topographical mode entered successfully. Milkyway design lib, RVT/LVT/HVT MW reference libs, SAED32 tech file, and TLU+ RC files were used. Outputs: 2_Synthesis/2_Output/pre_dft_topo/cv32e40p_synth_wrap.pre_dft_topo.{ddc,vg,sdc,sdf} and 2_Synthesis/2_Output/svf/cv32e40p_synth_wrap.pre_dft_topo.svf. DC QoR: setup WNS 1.61 ns, TNS 0.00, no setup/hold violating paths, cell area 45313.37. DC still reports max_cap/max_transition DRC violations, so this is timing-clean but DRC-not-clean.

Date: 2026-05-07
Command: source ~/.bashrc; pt_shell -f 6_STA/0_Script/run_pt_pre_dft_10ns_sdf.tcl
Stage: PrimeTime pre-DFT SDF STA
Result: PASS_WITH_NOTE
Notes: PT linked the topographical netlist, read functional 10 ns SDC, and annotated DC-generated SDF with 0 read_sdf errors. Annotated arcs: 106265 cell delay arcs, 43148 net delay arcs, 13076 timing checks, 6390 constraints. check_timing succeeded. No setup or hold violations. Worst setup slack is 1.61 ns; worst hold slack is 0.06 ns. PT still reports max_cap violations, so this is SDF timing-clean but DRC-not-clean.
